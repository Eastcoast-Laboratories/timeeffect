TIMEEFFECT Beta 1.1 (e), RC 1

################################
1. Dependencies
To run TIMEEFFECT you need a working MySQL database server (version 3.23 or higher). You may download the
MySQL database at http://www.mysql.com/.

Furthermore you need a running Apache (v. 1.3 or higher) with PHP4 support.
Both packages can be downloaded at http://www.apache.org/ and http://www.php.net/.

################################
2. Preparation
2.1 MySQL
Before you actually install the TIMEEFFECT package you have to create a new database and a database user with
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE rights on the created database within your MySQL system .
By default the prepared database name is ‘timeffect’, the appropriate user
is ‘timeeffect’ with the password ‘PfTe04’. If you stick to those parameters you won’t have to
change the data during the installation of the system.

2.2	PHP
To have TIMEEFFECT running you need to set the value of the directive 'register_globals' in
your php.ini to ‘On’ (‘register_globals = On’). You can figure out where your php.ini
is located by creating a php script with the following content: <?php phpinfo(); ?>.
By opening this script in your browser you will get a detailed overview of your PHP settings.

3. Installation
For the final installation of TIMEEFFECT now extract the contents of the tarball in a directory which
is located under the document root of your web server.
Now open the installation script ‘http://www.somedoain.com/timeeffect/install/’ in your web-browser.

4. Customizing
After Installation you may edit the file ‘aperetiv.inc.php’ which is located in the directory ‘include’.
Enter the data that matches your local installation.
